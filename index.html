      <h2>Mash</h2>
      <p>The milled malt is mixed with water in the mash tun  mashing-in. The starch in the grist dissolves and sugar, protein and tannin are released. The so-called malt extract is produced by this mashing process.</p>
      <h2>Fermetation</h2>
      <p>The second step in the beer making process is the alcoholic fermentation. This takes place in a fermentation tank where special brewing yeast is added. The yeast turns the malt sugar into alcohol and carbon dioxide. As soon as the malt sugar has fermented the yeast sinks and is collected. Depending on the type of yeast and the wort preparation used a top- or bottom-fermented beer is produced.</p>
      <h2>Filling</h2>
      <p>The final stage in the brewing process is the filling. Bottled beer and cans from Braeu am Berg are filled in the filling station Starzinger. The beer is filled using counter pressure to prevent any carbon dioxide from escaping. Barrels are filled directly in our brewery.</p>
